Essentially, the more governance tokens you have, the more influential you will become on the DAO's decisions. In this case, since tokens can be bought, influence can be bought as well.\n","- **Membership**: This DAO utilizes the one-member-one-vote voting mechanism. This is in line with the proof-of-personhood participation model that we discussed. However, since one member could create several wallets, this is not bullet proof.\n","- **Reputation**: This DAO also utilizes the non-tranferrable token voting power voting mechanism. While the amount of tokens you own, also represent the amount of influence you have, you are not able to buy or sell the token. The token is send or erased from your wallet based on your positive or negative impact on the DAO. This mechanism hols similar elements to the skin-in-the-game model that we discussed.\n","\n","Go through the rest of the process to launch your DAO.
