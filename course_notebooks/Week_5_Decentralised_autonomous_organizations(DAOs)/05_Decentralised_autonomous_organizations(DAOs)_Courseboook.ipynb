    "### What is a DAO?\n",
    "\n",
    "DAO stands for **D**ecentralised **A**utonomous **O**rganization. In its simplest form you can imagine it as a group of people with a joint bank acccount (= treasury). Since its decentralised, there is no single stakeholders who controls it's assets, and a community voting process is required to make decisions. Individuals can become part of a DAO by investing currency and exchanging it for the native token that governs the DAO. Their money is added to the treasury of the DAO, and the received tokens for their payment represent their stake and ownership which are necessary to participate in any votes that is posed by the community to the community. Additionally, the value of the DAOs native token can appreciate benefitting all stakeholders. \n",

    "While this might be easy to comprehend at first, the implications of what a DAO could mean to the blockchain community are huge. To put this into perspective, let's dive into an example of \"The DAO\", which at one point controlled approximately 14% of all ether (ETH) in circulation."

    "In the beginning of May 2016, members of the Ethereum ecosystem announced the founding of the DAO, also known as Genesis DAO. The idea was simple. The DAO intended to operate like a venture capital fund to invest into projects in web3. During a creation period anyone was allowed to send ether to a governing ethereum wallet controlled by the DAO collective. Innovators could pitch ideas to the DAO community, upon which the community would initiate a vote whether to invest or not. If invested and the projects turns into a success, the entire community benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within four weeks the DAO was able to raise 12.7 million Ether (at the time around worth over 250 USD million with a ETH price of 20USD), one of the biggest fundraising efforts at the time, but then we worst case scenario occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "On June 17th, 2016, a hacker was able to steal 3.6 million ETH within a few hours, exploiting a loophole in the smart contracts that governed the DAO. This hack affected the entire ethereum ecosystem and its price. The founder of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin reacted swiftly and initiated a hard-forck, an update to the ethereum blockchain that effectively rolled back the Ethereum networkâ€™s history to before The DAO attack and reallocated The DAOâ€™s ether to a different smart contract so that investors could withdraw their funds. This was extremely controversial, and since the ethereum founders did not unilateral power,miners, exchanges and node operators had to agree too.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a heated debate in public forums, on July 20, 2016, at block 192,000, the Ethereum hard fork was implemented.\n",
