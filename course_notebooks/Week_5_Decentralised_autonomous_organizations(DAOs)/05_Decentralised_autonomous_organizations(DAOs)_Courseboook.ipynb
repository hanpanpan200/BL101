    "DAO stands for **D**ecentralised **A**utonomous **O**rganization. In its simplest form you can imagine it as a group of people with a joint bank acccount (= treasury). Since its decentralised, there is no single stakeholders who controls it's assets, and a community voting process is required to make decisions. Individuals can become part of a DAO by investing currency and exchanging it for the native token that governs the DAO. Their money is added to the treasury of the DAO, and the received tokens for their payment represent their stake and ownership which are necessary to participate in any votes that is posed by the community to the community.

    "The backbone of a DAO is its smart contract. The contract defines the rules of the organization and holds the group's treasury. Once the contract is live on Ethereum, no one can change the rules except by a vote. If anyone tries to do something that's not covered by the rules and logic in the code, it will fail. And because the treasury is defined by the smart contract too that means no one can spend the money without the group's approval either. This means that DAOs don't need a central authority. Instead, the group makes decisions collectively, and payments are automatically authorized when votes pass.    "

    "In the beginning of May 2016, members of the Ethereum ecosystem announced the founding of the DAO, also known as Genesis DAO. The idea was simple. The DAO intended to operate like a venture capital fund to invest into projects in web3. During a creation period anyone was allowed to send ether to a governing ethereum wallet controlled by the DAO collective. Innovators could pitch ideas to the DAO community, upon which the community would initiate a vote whether to invest or not. If invested and the projects turns into a success, the entire community benefits.\n",

    "On June 17th, 2016, a hacker was able to steal 3.6 million ETH within a few hours, exploiting a loophole in the smart contracts that governed the DAO. This hack affected the entire ethereum ecosystem and its price. The founder of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin reacted swiftly and initiated a hard-forck, an update to the ethereum blockchain that effectively rolled back the Ethereum network’s history to before The DAO attack and reallocated The DAO’s ether to a different smart contract so that investors could withdraw their funds. This was extremely controversial, and since the ethereum founders did not unilateral power,miners, exchanges and node operators had to agree too.\n",

    "2. **Share-based**: Shares represent voting rights. Membership can be gained by submitting a proposal.

    "![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrd15hnvls3jvw5/traditional_organization-vs-DAO.png?raw=1)  \n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional organizations all members have legal contracts which constitutes the relationship among the members and toward the organization: employment contracts, constitutional law in democracies, membership contract in clubs, etc. The motivation for the members to engage in the organisation (incentives) are salary, the voting outcome, the benefits of joining the club, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "DAOs, on the other hand, involve a set of people interacting with each other according to a self-enforcing open-source protocol. Instead of legal contracts, DAOs use a majority consensus defined in smart contracts and executed with tokens. Blockchains and smart contracts reduce transaction costs of management. Individual behaviour is incentivized with a token to collectively contribute to a common goal. Members of a DAO are not bound together by a legal entity, although the legal situation differs between countries and purpose of the DAO (👉🏻 Legality).\n",
    "\n",
    "**DAOs can solve the principal-agent dilemma**\n",
    "DAOs tackle an age-old problem of governance where the agents (e.g. manager, politicians) have the power to make decisions in behalf of the principals (e.g. shareholder, citicens). In those situations *moral hazard* can occur - a situation where the agent has an incentive to increase its exposure to risk because it does not bear the full costs of that risk. (e.g.: A manager decides a risky investment. If it is succesfull he will get a bonus payment, if it fails the shareholder will cover the losses.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "DAOs on the other hand are open-source, thus transparent and, in theory, incorruptible. All transactions of the organization are recorded and maintained on a blockchain. Interests of the members of the organization are – if designed correctly – aligned by the incentive rules tied to the native token. Proposals take the primary way for making decisions within a DAO, which are voted for by majority consensus of involved network actors. As such, DAOs can be seen as distributed organisms, or distributed Internet tribes, that live on the Internet and exist autonomously, but also heavily rely on specialist individuals or smaller organisations to perform certain tasks that cannot be replaced with automation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to traditional companies that are structured in a top-down manner, with many layers of management and bureaucratic coordination, DAOs provide an operating system for people and institutions that do not know nor trust each other, who might live in different geographical areas, speak different languages, and therefore be subject to different jurisdictions.\n",

    "**Where is the registered office of a DAO?**  \n",
    "By definition, a DAO is a blockchain-based organization operating with no central location, headquarters, or centralized decision-making authority. \n",
    "DAOs are decentralized and exists solely on a blockchain with potentially thousands of members spread across the globe. \n",
    "If someone wants to sue a DAO, where to send the accusal documents? \n",
    "\n",
    "**How does a DAO enter a legally binding contract?**  \n",
    "And are members of a DAO personal liable for any action of the DAO (beside the value of the token they invested)?  \n",
    "The problem is that some lawyers might consider a DAO as a general partnership or unincorporated association with full personal liability of its members. This unclear legal situation can make it also difficult for DAOs to find business partners as businesses and investors might be discouraged to engage with the DAO. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical workaround is to adapt an *LLC Wrapper* for the DAO. An LLC in the USA is a limited liability company which protects its members from any personal liability and losses exceeding the companyies share capital. But personal liabiltiy can still exist in case of gross negligence - for all members or only for the managing directors, depending on the state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most countries in the world have simular legal concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all DAOs chose this business structure. Some worry that forming an LLC takes away the decentralization that is a key element of a DAO. \n",

    "In 2017, the large number of ICOs attracted the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The commission’s position was that the tokens offered in these ICOs had to be treated as securities under US law. As a consequence more and more blockchain projects followed a **dual-token model**.  The dual token model occurs when a blockchain project issues two tokens – one for fundraising and the other for utility. \n",
    "Many DAOs nowaday follow a **dual-token model** - seperating governance tokens (rights to a formal vote) and transactional tokens. But depending on the business model of the DAO it might also be \n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Case: DAOs in Wyoming\n",
    "With the purpose of making the process of a DAO becoming an LLC easier and cheaper and attracting more DAOs, the US state Wyoming enacted a statute in 2021 allowing a new legal entity — a *DAO LLC* — to be formed.  Everybody can register a DAO in Wyoming. However, a Wyoming registered agent who can receive legal mail on behalf of the DAO is needed. The inital filing fee is 100 USD and the annual filing fee is 60 USD. The name of the DAO must include \"DAO LLC\".\n",

    "The legal situation of DAOs is currently a hot topic and it can be expected that other US states and countries will follow Wyomings example: The US state Tennesse established a similar law recently and the US state Vermont furthermore enacted a law that allows the creation and registration of a **BBLLC**: blockchain-based limited liability company.
